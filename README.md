# Atmosphere-thomsonization
Computing intensity and polarization degree of emergent radiation from electron-scattering dominated atmosphere. 

Code structure
---------------------------------------

* cs.py -  Main model for polarized pulse-spectral computation
* cs_ts2_func.py - Almost same as previous but as a function used e.g. for mcmc fitting. 
* driver_paeqs.py - Simple tool to run the previous function
* emcee_cs_ts.py - Fitting PA profiles using emcee.
